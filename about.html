  <h1>Iron Lunch: Mission and Inspiration</h1>

  <p>My mission is to help workers improve their health through easy daily actions and to bring workplaces together around shared, human-centered goals.</p>

  <p>While I could name several influences and experiences that led me to create this business, there are three that stand out:</p>

  <h2>Kaizen</h2>

  <p>Kaizen is a Japanese business philosophy that emphasizes small actions and incremental changes to achieve long-term results. It is a powerful reminder that great things take time to build, and that even the smallest of steps, if taken consistently, will lead to incredible success over time.</p>

  <p>Think of the adages: "Rome wasn’t built in a day" or "What’s the only way to eat an elephant?" (One bite at a time, of course!). While it’s easy to forget to prioritize our well-being throughout the workday, it’s important to remember that small actions add up over time. That’s what Kaizen is all about.</p>

  <p>Iron Lunch is designed with Kaizen in mind: encouraging small, manageable health actions each day.</p>

  <h2>“Together” by Vivek Murthy</h2>

  <p>This book explores what’s been termed the “Loneliness Epidemic” and offers solutions to bring people together during what has become the loneliest time in human history. Reading <em>Together</em> changed my perspectives on a lot of things. It helped me learn to prioritize time spent with others and underscored the role of positive interactions in my own happiness.</p>

  <p>I sincerely hope that Iron Lunch not only helps people feel better through consistent daily action but also brings workers closer together over time.</p>

  <h2>The Rising Prevalence of Chronic Illness Associated with Sedentary Work</h2>

  <p>People tend to overestimate the risks of immediate dangers (like a plane crashing) and underestimate the risks of things that accumulate over time (like how an extra slice of pizza will affect heart health). This tendency is especially dangerous in office work. Sitting down and working for eight hours a day, over time, leads to serious long-term health risks.</p>

  <p>Over the past year, I’ve done extensive research into the health habits and health outcomes of office workers and have developed a clear idea of what level of activity won’t disrupt the workday too much but will be meaningfully beneficial to workers. Iron Lunch is my first attempt to apply this idea to an actual business.</p>

  <h2>In Closing</h2>

  <p>Iron Lunch is built on the idea that small steps, shared purpose, and proactive habits can make work healthier and a little bit more enjoyable. I hope that it is fun, engaging and becomes a meaningful workday routine for employees.</p>

  <h2>About Me</h2>

He currently is Records Coordinator at Dentons Cohen & Grigsby and is the founder of Iron Lunch. He is a strong believer that the future of work is rooted in the promotion of positive health habits and the encouragement of meaningful connections.</p>
