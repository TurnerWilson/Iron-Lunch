  <h1>Iron Lunch: My Mission and Influences</h1>

  <p>My mission is to help workers improve their health through easy daily actions — and to bring workplaces together around shared, human-centered goals.</p>

  <p>While I could name several influences and experiences that led me to create this business, there are three that stand out:</p>

  <h2>Kaizen</h2>

  <p>Kaizen is a Japanese business philosophy that emphasizes small actions and incremental changes to achieve long-term results. It is a powerful reminder that great things take time to build, and that even the smallest of steps, if taken consistently, will lead to incredible success over time.</p>

  <p>Think of the adages: "Rome wasn’t built in a day" or "What’s the only way to eat an elephant?" (One bite at a time, of course!). While it’s easy to forget to prioritize health throughout the workday, it’s important to remember that small actions add up over time.</p>

  <p>Iron Lunch is designed with Kaizen in mind: encouraging small, manageable health actions each day — building momentum without overwhelming workers or employers.</p>

  <p>Here’s a link to a short video on Kaizen:<br>

  <h2>Together by Vivek Murthy</h2>

  <p>This book explores what’s been termed the “Loneliness Epidemic” and offers solutions to bring people together during what has become the loneliest time in human history. Reading Together changed my perspectives on a lot of things. It helped me learn to prioritize time spent with others and underscored the value of positive interactions for happiness.</p>

  <p>I sincerely hope that Iron Lunch not only helps people feel better but also brings them together in the pursuit of a common, non-work-related goal. It’s very easy to get lost in tasks, but workplace happiness matters.</p>

  <h2>The Rising Prevalence of Chronic Illness Associated with Sedentary Work</h2>

  <p>People tend to overestimate the risks of immediate dangers (like a plane crashing) and underestimate the risks of things that accumulate over time (like how an extra slice of pizza will affect heart health). This tendency is especially dangerous in office work. Sitting down and working for eight hours a day, over time, can lead to serious long-term health risks.</p>

  <p>Over the past year, I’ve done extensive research into the health habits and health outcomes of office workers, and have developed a clear idea of what level of activity won’t disrupt the workday too much but will be meaningfully beneficial to workers.</p>

  <h2>Closing</h2>

  <p>Iron Lunch is built on the idea that small steps, shared purpose, and proactive habits can make work not just healthier, but happier. That’s the kind of workplace I want to help create.</p>
